Development of an Enterprise System for Satellite Image Processing Using Artificial Intelligence.

Using Techniques Like:Â 

1- Histogram Stretching:
	- Histogram Equalization.
	- Minimum Maximum.
	- Standard Deviation.
 
2- Image Filtration:
	- Sobel Filter.
	- High Pass Filter.
	- Low Pass Filter.
	- Median Filter.
 
3- Image Transformation:
	- Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
 	- Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).
	- Independent Component Analysis (ICA).
	- Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF).
 
4- Super Resolution:
	- Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN).
	- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).
